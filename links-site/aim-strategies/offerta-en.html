               After placing an order and paying for it, in each individual case, you have the right to refuse services and request a refund. You have the right to refuse paid services by notifying us within the prescribed time frame.
               The date we receive your return request determines whether you will be able to receive a refund, as well as the amount of any withholding associated with the return. <br> <br>
               You understand and agree that if you have already started using the services (gained access to one or more training program sessions, access to an online event, access to a private chat for counseling, mentoring, webinar, their recordings or other recorded materials ) during the refusal period, we have the right to withhold from the amount paid by you the amount of the cost of services actually provided at the time of receipt of the refund request. <br> <br>
               Online Learning Opt-Out Policy
               You have the right to cancel online training (access to training recordings, access to an online event, access to private chat for consulting, mentoring, webinars and other paid training content) within fourteen (14) calendar days of order confirmation.
               If you request a refund within the due date, we will refund the payments received from you as payment for the course. To receive a refund, please contact us and submit a refund request in the prescribed manner.
               If you have already started using the services during the withdrawal period (for example, you took part in one or more online classes or received a link to watch or download video lessons), we will deduct from the amount you paid the cost of the services actually provided at the time of submitting your request for return. In this case, the refund amount is determined as the difference between the total cost of services and the cost of actually consumed services.

               Offline Events Opt-Out Policy

               (B) in the period from twenty-nine (29) to fifteen (15) calendar days inclusive before the scheduled date of the event or master class, regardless of the reasons for refusal - we return the funds received, withholding seventy-five (75)% of the amount paid amounts; <br> <br>
               (D) less than fifteen (15) calendar days before the scheduled date of the event, as well as after the start of the event (first day) and later, we will not issue a refund. We will retain the entire amount of the advance as compensation for damage caused by unilateral withdrawal from the contract. <br> <br>
               Processing a return <br> <br>
               To cancel services and issue a return, write to us at support@aims.expert​, we will confirm receipt of the return request by email to the address specified when placing the order. If you do not receive written confirmation within 24 hours from the moment the letter was sent, contact our support team in Telegram by phone +380936609298. <br> <br>
               To process a return, be sure to tell us: full name and email specified when placing the order; name of the service (consulting program, education, training or package of services); order date; information about payments; reasons for refusing services, as well as other necessary information. <br> <br>
               You understand that if you violate the procedure for completing a return request or do not provide us with the specified information, we have the right to refuse your return and not consider your request. <br> <br>
               Consequences of refusal of services <br> <br>
               If you request a refund within the specified time frame, we will refund you within sixty (60) days from the date we receive your request.<br> <br>
               To receive a refund, we will use the same payment method that you used to pay for the services. We will deduct from the refund amount all additional fees of banks and payment systems associated with the refund. <br> <br>
               If you did not use the services (did not take part in an online event, mentoring, webinar or other paid training consultation) through no fault of ours or refused to use the services in violation of the terms and established procedure, we will not reimburse you for the cost of such services. <br> <br>
               Special cancellation conditions and additional return guarantees
               We specifically reserve the right to establish different cancellation policies for specific Services (training programs, products, live events, webinars, intensives, etc.) or provide you with additional unconditional return guarantees by posting specific cancellation policies on the product order page. <br> <br>
               Postponement of the terms of provision of Services
               For good reason, no later than one (1) month from the date of payment for the Services (making the first payment), you have the right to request a postponement of the provision of Consulting Services to other calendar dates and undergo training with the next stream of the course or with the next group (under the terms of a similar package services equivalent to the cost purchased). <br> <br>
               A valid reason means circumstances that do not allow you to complete the training as planned due to health reasons (illness, injury, quarantine restrictions, etc.), subject to confirmation of such circumstances. <br> <br>
               In this case, no refund will be provided, and we will notify you of new possible calendar dates for training. Rescheduling for the provision of Services is possible no more than once.
               Please note that the price for a similar package of services may vary. If the cost of the transferred product exceeds the amount you paid (deposit), you agree to pay the difference before the Services begin. If the deposit amount exceeds the cost of the ordered product, the difference in cost will not be refunded. <br> <br>


               To comply with the deadline, you only need to notify us in the manner prescribed for filing a return request.
               We certainly reserve the right to establish different rescheduling policies for individual products by posting additional rescheduling terms on the product page. <br> <br>
               Expiration of the withdrawal period
               In the event that the Services were provided in full before the expiration of the refusal period (for example: you have already gained access to lessons and materials, took part in online training, webinar, consulting) and/or before receiving a request for a refund, refund funds are not implemented. <br> <br>
               If a request for a refund (refusal of services) is received in violation of the established deadlines for refusal, no refund will be made. <br> <br>
               Using funds to pay for another product
               No later than fourteen (14) days from the date of payment, you have the right to request that the funds paid be credited towards payment for any of our other products (Services). If the cost of the purchased product exceeds the amount you paid (deposit), you agree to pay the difference before the start of the Services. If the deposit amount exceeds the cost of the ordered product, the difference in cost will not be refunded. <br> <br>
               To comply with the deadline, you must notify us in the manner prescribed for filing a return request. <br> <br>
               12. RIGHT TO USE AimsExpert CONTENT <br> <br>

               We have the right, at our choice, to demand from the violator full compensation for losses caused by such violation or payment by the violator of compensation in the amount of double the fee for the lawful use of intellectual property for each case of unlawful use. <br> <br>
               If the violator refuses to voluntarily pay compensation, we will be forced to contact law enforcement agencies, initiate criminal prosecution of the violator and collect monetary compensation forcibly.
